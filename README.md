# Transport-Management-System-application-using-MS-Access-and-Power-BI
This application is Proof Of Concept for FR8 Logistics TMS application that allows users to book and track delivery truck trips. It allows management to gain insights about transportation related costs, vehicle usage and delays.

SITUATION:
FR8 Logistics is a trusted online truck booking platform that offers verified trucks, transparent rates, and 100% delivery guarantee across India. In initial stages of application development, application design for booking and tracking trips became crucial. The company wanted to find out best possible innovative design of their database architecture that not just allows customers to book/track trips but also allow management to gain insights into how well they are performing. 

TASK:
There is a need to create a Proof of Concept application that uses an optimized database architecture and innovative user interface. FR8 logistics can then evaluate this and implement the necessary features in their application. 

ACTION:

1. We use the below tables,queries, forms and macros to manipulate information to develop the application.
